***************************** for Xuan ********************************************

The command to run s3fp is:

    s3fp $(bitWidthOfEachInput) $(numberOfInputs) inputFile pyFileOne pyFileOneOutput pyFileTwo pyFileTwoOutput

the directory in which this command is run must have an s3fp configuration file in it that specifies other parameters for the testing. I've checked a sample one of these into the /tests directory that you can use. I've also checked in two sample programs in that same directory to test your modifications to s3fp on

for doubles, the bit width should be 64. the number of inputs will vary depending on the function being tested. the inputFile name can just be test_input; s3fp will automatically generate this and continuously modify it

TODO:

    Item 1:
        as is, s3fp calls a c program with two CL arguments: inputName and outputName
            eg) ./test input output
        can we modify it to call a python program with three CL arguments? This will be compatible with our drivers.
            eg) python3 doubleInput intInput output

        If we can do this, the int file will be predefined and exist in the same directory as the tests.

        To complete this task incrementally, you can modify the drivers I included so that they only take two CL arguments; the function I chose only takes two doubles, but in general, we will be expecting functions that take ints and doubles.

    Item 2:
        ALSO, s3fp currently requires that the programs it is testing output quad precision numbers (based on the fact that they are assuming we have both a quad and a double precision version of the same program). Since we are not doing this, we need to relax this requirement and just allow for doubles.

This README file describes basic installation and usage of S3FP. 
For more information and tutorial, 
please access the user guide in doc (directory) or online. 


========================
Required Library Requirement
========================
1. libquadmath
2. libpthread : For parallel RT. 
3. boost library 


========================
Optional Library Requirement
========================
1. QD library 


========================
Compile S3FP 
========================
1. 
Specify library paths in the Makefile in "trunk" directory: 
Modify "BOOST_INC" to "-I (your boost root directory)" 
For example, 

    BOOST_INC = -I /home/wfchiang/lib/boost_1_54_0

Modify "QD_HOME" to the directory of your QD library. 
For example, 

    QD_HOME=/home/wfchiang/lib/qd-2.3.14/install

However, using QD library is optional. 
  
2. 
Please do "make" for using 128-bit IEEE floating-point number arithmetic to approximate precise arithmetic. 

3. 
It is optional to use double-double floating-point numbers to approximate real numbers. 
To use this option, the library path of your QD library is needed in the Makefile. 
To compile, please do "make core-dd". 


========================
Setting of S3FP 
========================
S3FP reads a file that describes it setting. 
The file name is "s3fp_setting." 
The content of this file is described as follows: 

1. Select RT search strategy: 

    RT = URT   : Unguided Random Testing 
       | BGRT  : Binary Guided Random Testing
       | ILS   : Iterated Local Search 
       | PSO   : Particle Swarm Optimization 

2. Select timeout and resource: 
  
    TIMEOUT = (possitive integer) : Setting "time." The amount of resource. 
    RESOURCE = TIME : Using time as resource. 
             | SVE  : Using the total times of shadow value executions as resource. 
3. Select random seed:

    RSEED = (natural number) 

4. Enable/Disable parallel RT: 

    PARALLELRT = true | false   : Turn on/off of parallel RT. 

5. Select floating-point error matrix: 

    FTERROR = ABS  : Use absolute error as matrix
            | REL  : Use relative error as matrix 
            | ULP  : Use units in the last place error

6. Select a cut-off parameter for the relative error:

    REL_DELTA = (floating-point number)

This parameter is used in the relative error computation:

    rel_err = (x_lp - x_hp) / (sign(x_hp) * max(|x_hp|, REL_DELTA))
   
Where x_lp is the result of low-precision computations and
x_hp is the result of high-precision computations.
If this parameter is missing, it will assume the default value 0.

7. Specify uniform input: 

    UNIFORM_INPUT = true | false

8. Specify the lower bound of uniform input: 

    UNIFORM_INPUTLB = (floating-point number)

If UNIFORM_INPUT is true, UNIFORM_INPUTLB must be specified. 

9. Specify the upper bound of uniform input: 

    UNIFORM_INPUTUB = (floating-point number) 

If UNIFORM_INPUT is true, UNIFORM_INPUTUB must be specified. 

10. Specify the input range file: 

    INPUT_RANGE_FILE = (file path) 

If UNIFORM_INPUT is false, INPUT_RANGE_FILE must be specified. 
The file format is described in the following section. 

11. (Optional) Specify configuration-to-error(s) to file

    CONF_TO_ERRORS_FILE = (file path)

If specifying CONF_TO_ERRORS_FILE, S3FP will dump configuration-to-errors to the specified file. 


========================
Input Range File
========================
Each line of the input range file should contain (only) two floating-point numbers which denotes the lower and the upper bounds of an input variable. 
The total line numbers should be equal to the number of input variables. 

For example, there are three input variables, v1, v2, and v3. 
Their (initial) ranges are: 

    v1 : [0.00001, 2.0]
    v2 : [0.1, 1.0]
    v3 : [-1.0, 1.0]

The input range file should be: 

    1e-05 2.0
    0.1 1.0
    -1.0 1.0


========================
Using S3FP 
========================
1. 
Users should create their own low precision and high precision versions of 
programs (executables). 
The low precision executable performs low precision floating-point calculation.
The high precision executable performs high precision calculation. 

2. 
Prepare the setting file of S3FP.
(Described previously.) 

3. 
Suppose the executable of S3FP is "s3fp," 
run S3FP with the following command: 

    s3fp INPUT_WIDTH N_INPUTS INPUT_FILE_NAME LOW_EXE LOW_OUTPUT_FILE HIGH_EXE HIGH_OUTPUT_FILE

The arguments are explained as follows: 

INPUT_WIDTH: 
The bit-width of all input floating-point. 
S3FP will generate a sequence of floating-point numbers as an input 
whose bit-widthes are all the same as specified. 

N_INPUTS:
The number of a floating-point numbers per input. 

INPUT_FILE:
The input file name. 

LOW_EXE:
The name of the low precision executable. 

LOW_OUTPUT_FILE:
The output file name of the low precision executable. 

HIGH_EXE:
The name of the high precision executable. 

HIGH_OUTPUT_FILE:
The output file name of the high precision executable. 

4. 
The user program is called with two parameters: the name of an input file and
the name of an output file. The input file contains 128-bit floating-point numbers
representing all input values. Note that the 128-bit floating-point values are actually 
INPUT_WIDTH-bit FP numbers. Note that the order of reading input values MUST BE deterministic. 
The (single) output value should be converted to a 128-bit floating-point number. This value
must be written to the output file, which name is given as the second program parameter.
We currently allow a single output only. 

Our multi-threaded S3FP currently supports sequential programs only. S3FP will employ 
multiple threads to execute the sequential program. Names of input and output files
will be different for different S3FP threads.

4(a).
A simple way to create the user program is to include the existing file test2/common.h.
This file contains all necessary functions for dealing with S3FP input/output. It also
contains the main function. The entry point of the user program is the following
function:
FT compute(int inputSize, FT *data)

Here, FT is a macro which defines the type of floating-point values in the program.
The default value of FT is "float". Compiling the user program with the flag
-DFT=double will change the floating-point type to the double precision, etc.

The function compute() takes two parameter. The first parameter gives the size of input and
the second parameter is an array of all input values. The function compute() should return
a single value: the result of computations which will be used for the error analysis.

The directory test2 contains several test programs. To run a test program, go to
the corresponding directory and type
make
make test-bgrt-seq
This will run a sequential BGRT search procedure. Change bgrt to urt to run the URT procedure.
Change seq to par to run the parallel search.
